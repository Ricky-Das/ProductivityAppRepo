# Phase 1 Overview

### Due Date: June 11th
### Success Criteria: The essential tasks screen must be completed to maximal functionality with in depth tasks and storage solutions.

---

## Primary Objective
Create a working tasks screen with a fully functional back-end.

## Requirements
- The screen must have a header at the top with the name tasks
- The screen must have an add button that is clearly visible and easy to use but not in the way.
- The screen must have a list of tasks with minimal, important information
- The back-end must be scalable
- The back-end system must allow for full task functionality: task id, task name, task notes, task priority, task subtasks, task due date, task time due

## Restrictions
- User interface should be minimal - not a focus right now
- No financial resources are allowed to be allocated - all back-end functionality must be implemented without capital
